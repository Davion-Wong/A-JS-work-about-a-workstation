# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

My work is obviously a lathe. The white rectangle in the up-middle is the cynlindrical metal material to be shaped.

To let it work, the user needs to press 'T' on the keyboard to turn on this machine. Pressing 'W', 'S', 'A', and 'D' can move the knife horizontally and vertically, so the user can customize his own shape for the material.

The visual experience and the smooth control are the most focused parts, including blinking stars, rising bubbles, wandering fish, kangaroo boxer tumbler, splash effect, color-changing switch, rotating holders, moving knife, motion control knob and all other details. 

(Make sure you see the splashes when the material is being shaped.)

(To hit the kangaroo boxer tumbler, click on his head!)

Various elements are applied to finish this work, including HSB color mode, loops, arrays, objects(bubbles and splashes), condition, text, hierachical transformations, scale, rotate, functions, and randomness.
